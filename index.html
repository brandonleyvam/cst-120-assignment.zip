  <p class="about-paragraph">
     Hey, my name is Brandon Leyva Martinez. I am a first year student at Grand Canyon University and I am greatly enjoying my new lifestyle. I am born and raised here, in Phoenix, Arizona. I attended Apollo High School in Glendale, and I graduated with an Honors Diploma. I am currently completing my core classes and one Software class, since that will be my major, Software Development. Long term I hope to move to Colorado with my newly obtained degree where I will pursue a job in my desired profession. I am a very innovative person and I hope to use my software to develop some sort of project that will be incorporated into the medical field. I am also very ambitious and I love to learn new things every chance I get. Anyways, that's a little about me and here is my webpage.
